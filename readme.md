Code Challenge for Sr. Full-Stack Software Engineer Position
# Code Challenge: Build a Simple RESTful API with TypeScript and Python

Challenge Overview
As a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer, you will be tasked with creating a simple RESTful API that allows users to manage a list of tasks. The API should support the following operations:

Create a new task

Retrieve all tasks

Update a task

Delete a task

You will implement the API using TypeScript for the front-end and Python for the back-end. The back-end should use Flask as the web framework and store tasks in a PostgreSQL database.

Requirements

Back-End (Python with Flask):

Create a Flask application that connects to a PostgreSQL database.

Implement the following endpoints:

POST /tasks: Create a new task.

GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.

PUT /tasks/<id>: Update a task by ID.

DELETE /tasks/<id>: Delete a task by ID.

Each task should have an ID, title, and completed status.



Front-End (TypeScript):

Create a simple front-end application that interacts with the API.

Use Fetch API to call the back-end endpoints and display the list of tasks.

Provide a form to create and update tasks.
